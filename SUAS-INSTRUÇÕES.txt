The solution for the Kart problem was developed in C++ on Windows with the Visual Studio IDE.

The program has two command line arguments:

<input> Path to the input file containing the race data
<output> Name of the output file containing the processed information

Example:

Windows environment: race.exe race.txt results.txt
Linux environment: ./race race.txt results.txt
